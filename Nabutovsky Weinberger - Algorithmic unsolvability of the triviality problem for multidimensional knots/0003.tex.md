Now we are going to describe an algorithm constructing for a given finite presentation of a group $K$ with properties (a), (b) a multidimensional knot in $\mathbb{R}^{n+2}$ such that its group is $K \times \mathbb{Z}$. The resulting knot will be presented in both forms (PL- and smooth polynomial) described in the text of Theorem 1. Moreover, if $K$ is the trivial group, then this algorithm produces a trivial knot.

One first constructs a smooth hypersurface $X^{n+2}=\Sigma^{n+1} \times S^{1}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n+3}$, if $n \geq 4$, and $M^{4} \times S^{1}$, if $n=3$, using the above-mentioned Kervaire construction from [K2] or the Markov construction described in [BHP]. If $n=3$ then one realizes a basis of $H_{2}\left(M^{4}\right)$ by embedded in $M^{4} \times S^{1}$ disjoint two-dimensional spheres and performs surgeries killing the corresponding elements of $\pi_{2}\left(M^{4} \times S^{1}\right)$. Denote the resulting manifold by $X^{5}$. (If $K$ is the trivial group, then the resulting manifold has the homotopy type of $S^{4} \times S^{1}$. In this case Corollary on p. 297 of [S] implies that $X^{5}$ is actually diffeomorphic to $S^{4} \times S^{1}$. If $n \geq 4$ and $K$ is the trivial group, then by virtue of the $h$-cobordism theorem $\Sigma^{n+1} \times S^{1}$ is also diffeomorphic to $S^{n+1} \times S^{1}$.) Note that for any $K$ and $n \geq 3$, $H_{2}\left(X^{n+2}\right)=\cdots=H_{n}\left(X^{n+2}\right)=\{0\}$. Now one realizes the element $(h, 1) \in \pi_{1}\left(X^{n+2}\right)$ by an embedded smooth closed curve $\gamma$ and performs the surgery killing this element and, thus, by virtue of (iii) the whole group $G=K \times \mathbb{Z}=\pi_{1}\left(X^{n+2}\right)$. Thus, the resulting manifold, which is constructed as a hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^{n+3}$, will be diffeomorphic to $S^{n+2}$. It is easy to see (cf. [K]) that the axis of the handle $D^{2} \times S^{n}$ attached during the last surgery will be the required knot in the constructed $S^{n+2}$. Denote this knot by $K n(K \times \mathbb{Z})$. If $K$ is the trivial group, then $\gamma$ will be isotopic to the meridian of $X^{n+2}=S^{n+1} \times S^{1}$. Hence in this case $K n(K \times \mathbb{Z})$ will be trivial.

By a PL- or a semialgebraic trial and error algorithm (as in [ABB] or [N1]; see also [BHP]) we can find a PL-homeomorphism of an appropriate triangulation of the constructed pair ($S^{n+2}, Kn(K \times \mathbb{Z})$) with a pair ($\partial \Delta^{n+3}, KnPL(K \times \mathbb{Z})$), where $\partial \Delta^{n+3}$ denotes the boundary of the standard $(n+3)$-dimensional simplex and $KnPL(K \times \mathbb{Z})$ denotes some its PL-submanifold; or a $C^{2}$-smooth semialgebraic homeomorphism of the pair $\left(S^{n+2}, K n(K \times \mathbb{Z})\right)$ with a pair $\left(\partial B^{n+3}, KnSm(K \times \mathbb{Z})\right)$, where $\partial B^{n+3}$ denotes the boundary of the unit ball centered at the origin in $\mathbb{R}^{n+3}$ and $KnSm(K \times \mathbb{Z})$ denotes some its smooth semialgebraic submanifold of codimension 2. (The relevant definitions from semialgebraic geometry can be found in [BCR].) A priori knowing that $KnPL(K \times \mathbb{Z})$ is PL-homeomorphic with $S^{n}$ (respectively, $KnSm(K \times \mathbb{Z})$ is diffeomorphic with $S^{n}$), we can find by a trial and error algorithm a PL-homeomorphism $\partial \Delta^{n+1} \rightarrow KnPL(K \times \mathbb{Z})$ (respectively, a $C^{2}$-smooth semialgebraic homeomorphism $S^{n} \rightarrow KnSm(K \times \mathbb{Z})$). It is easy now to modify the above-described construction in order to obtain the required knot in $\mathbb{R}^{n+2}$ (and not in $S^{n+2}$). (In the smooth case one can use the stereographic projection and a constructive version of the Weierstrass approximation theorem to obtain a polynomial map $f$.)
