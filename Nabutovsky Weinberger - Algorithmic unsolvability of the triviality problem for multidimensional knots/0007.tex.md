THEOREM 3. Let $n \geq 3$ be any fixed number. The function $\operatorname{Tr}_{n}(N)$ cannot be majorized by any Turing computable function of $N$.

Sketch of the proof. Assume that $\operatorname{Tr}_{n}(N)$ can be majorized by a Turing computable function of $N$. Now it is not difficult to construct an algorithm deciding whether or not a given PL-knot in $\mathbb{R}^{n+2}$ is trivial, thus obtaining a contradiction with Theorem 1. The idea is that for any $k$, $\operatorname{Knot}_{n}(k)$ can be regarded as a semi-algebraic set in an Euclidean space of a sufficiently large dimension. The possibility to compute an upper bound $\theta_{n}(N)$ for $\operatorname{Tr}_{n}(N)$ enables one to replace the triviality problem for PL-knots by the equivalent problem of recognizing whether or not a given point in $\operatorname{Knot}_{n}(N) \subset \operatorname{Knot}_{n}(\theta(N))$, where $N$ is a given number, belongs to the same connected component of $\operatorname{Knot}_{n}\left(\theta(N)\right)$ as the point, corresponding to the standard unknotted embedding of $S^{n}$ into $\mathbb{R}^{n+2}$. But it is well-known that the problem of recognizing whether or not two given points are in the same connected component of a given semi-algebraic set is algorithmically solvable (cf. [BCR]).

REMARK. The statement that $\operatorname{TrivKnot}_{n}(N)$ is disconnected is obviously equivalent to the inequality $\operatorname{Tr}_{n}(N)>N$. Hence Theorem 3 implies that for any $n \geq 3$ and for an infinite set of values of $N$, $\operatorname{TrivKnot}_{n}(N)$ is disconnected. Moreover, using Lemma 6 of [N4] instead of the mere algorithmic unsolvability of the halting problem for Turing machines in the foundation of the proof of Theorem 3 one can prove that not only $\operatorname{Tr}_{n}$ cannot be majorized by any Turing computable function, but that for any Turing computable function $\theta$ and any $n \geq 3$, $\operatorname{Tr}_{n}(N)>\theta(N)$ for all sufficiently large $N$. As a corollary, we see that for any $N \geq 3$ for all sufficiently large $N$, $\operatorname{TrivKnot}_{n}(N)$ is disconnected. (It is quite plausible, however, that $\operatorname{TrivKnot}_{1}(N)$ and $\operatorname{TrivKnot}_{2}(N)$ are also disconnected for all sufficiently large $N$, and that this statement admits a constructive proof.)

The methods of [N3] show that for $n \geq 3$ the number of connected components of $\operatorname{TrivKnot}_{n}(N)$ grows at least exponentially with $N$. In fact for any recursive function $f$ the rank of the image of $H_{0}\left(\operatorname{TrivKnot}_{n}(N)\right)$ in $H_{0}\left(\operatorname{TrivKnot}_{n}(f(N))\right)$ grows exponentially.

Other results about non-computability in geometry and its applications in the spirit of Theorem 3 can be found in [N0]-[N5], [ABB], [G, section 5.C].
