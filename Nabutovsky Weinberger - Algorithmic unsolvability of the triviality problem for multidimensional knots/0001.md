<p><a name=bookmark0><b>Algorithmic
unsolvability of the triviality problem for multidimensional knots</b></a></p>

<p>Alexander Nabutovsky and Shmuel Weinberger</p>

<p>Abstract. We prove that for any fixed n &#8805; 3 there is no algorithm deciding
whether or not a given knot f: S<sup>n</sup>&#8594;&#8477;<sup>n</sup> <sup>+ 2</sup>
is trivial. Some related results are also presented.</p>

<p>The classical result of W.
Haken ([H]) is that there exists an algorithm deciding whether or not a given
knot in &#8477;<sup>3</sup> is trivial.
Our main result (Theorem 1 below) establishes that this result is not true for
multidimensional knots. Our proof is in the same spirit as the algorithmic
unsolvability of the homeomorphism problem for manifolds of dimension <i>Â </i>&#8805;4, but
there is still a subtlety that prevents us from dealing with knots in 4-space
as the discerning reader will see.</p>

<p>THEOREM 1. <i>For any fixed n </i>&#8805;<i>3 there is no algorithm deciding whether or not a given knot f: </i>S<sup>n</sup>&#8594;&#8477;<sup>n+2 </sup>is trivial. <i>Here f is either a PL-embedding of the boundary of the
standard (n + 1)-dimensional simplex into </i>&#8477;<i><sup>n+2</sup> or a smooth embedding of S<sup>n </sup>into</i>
&#8477;<sup>n</sup> <sup>+ 2</sup> <i>given
by a (n + 2)-dimensional vector of trigonometric polynomials with rational
coefficients of the spherical angles.</i></p>
