Now we are going to describe an algorithm constructing for a given finite presentation of a group $K$ with properties (a), (b) a multidimensional knot in $\mathbb{R}^{n+2}$ such that its group is $K \times \mathbb{Z}$. The resulting knot will be presented in both forms (PL- and smooth polynomial) described in the text of Theorem 1. Moreover, if $K$ is the trivial group, then this algorithm produces a trivial knot.

One first constructs a smooth hypersurface $X^{n+2}=\Sigma^{n+1} \times S^{1}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n+3}$, if $n \geq 4$, and $M^{4} \times S^{1}$, if $n=3$, using the above-mentioned Kervaire construction from [K2] or the Markov construction described in [BHP]. If $n=3$ then one realizes a basis of $H_{2}\left(M^{4}\right)$ by embedded in $M^{4} \times S^{1}$ disjoint two-dimensional spheres and performs surgeries killing the corresponding elements of $\pi_{2}\left(M^{4} \times S^{1}\right)$. Denote the resulting manifold by $X^{5}$. (If $K$ is the trivial group, then the resulting manifold has the homotopy type of $S^{4} \times S^{1}$. In this case Corollary on p. 297 of [S] implies that $X^{5}$ is actually diffeomorphic to $S^{4} \times S^{1}$. If $n \geq 4$ and $K$ is the trivial group, then by virtue of the $h$-cobordism theorem $\Sigma^{n+1} \times S^{1}$ is also diffeomorphic to $S^{n+1} \times S^{1}$.) Note that for any $K$ and $n \geq 3 H_{2}\left(X^{n+2}\right)=\cdots=H_{n}\left(X^{n+2}\right)=\{0\}$. Now one realizes the element $(h, 1) \in \pi_{1}\left(X^{n+2}\right)$ by an embedded smooth closed curve $\gamma$ and performs the surgery killing this element and, thus, by virtue of (iii) the whole group $G=K \times \mathbb{Z}=\pi_{1}\left(X^{n+2}\right)$. Thus, the resulting manifold, which is constructed as a hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^{n+3}$, will be diffeomorphic to $S^{n+2}$. It is easy to see (cf. [K]) that the axis of the handle $D^{2} \times S^{n}$ attached during the last surgery will be the required knot in the constructed $S^{n+2}$. Denote this knot by $K n(K \times \mathbb{Z})$. If $K$ is the trivial group, then $\gamma$ will be isotopic to the meridian of $X^{n+2}=S^{n+1} \times S^{1}$. Hence in this case $K n(K \times \mathbb{Z})$ will be trivial.

By a PL- or a semialgebraic trial and error algorithm (as in [ABB] or [N1]; see also [BHP]) we can find a PL-homeomorphism of an appropriate triangulation of the constructed pair ( $\left.S^{n+2}, K n(K \times \mathbb{Z})\right)$ with a pair $\left(\partial \Delta^{n+3}, K n P L(K \times \mathbb{Z})\right.$ ), where $\partial \Delta^{n+3}$ denotes the boundary of the standard $(n+3)$-dimensional simplex and $K n P L(K \times \mathbb{Z})$ denotes some its PL-submanifold; or a $C^{2}$-smooth semialgebraic homeomorphism of the pair $\left(S^{n+2}, K n(K \times \mathbb{Z})\right)$ with a pair $\left(\partial B^{n+3}, \operatorname{KnSm}(K \times \mathbb{Z})\right)$, where $\partial B^{n+3}$ denotes the boundary of the unit ball centered at the origin in $\mathbb{R}^{n+3}$ and $\operatorname{KnSM}(K \times \mathbb{Z})$ denotes some its smooth semialgebraic submanifold of codimension 2. (The relevant definitions from semialgebraic geometry can be found in [BCR].) A priori knowing that $K n P L(K \times \mathbb{Z})$ is PL-homeomorphic with $S^{n}$ (respectively, $K n S m(K \times \mathbb{Z})$ is diffeomorphic with $S^{n}$), we can find by a trial and error algorithm a

PL-homeomorphism $\partial \Delta^{n+1} \rightarrow K n P L(K \times \mathbb{Z})$ (respectively, a $C^{2}$-smooth semialgebraic homeomorphism $S^{n} \rightarrow \operatorname{KnSm}(K \times \mathbb{Z})$ ). It is easy now to modify the above-described construction in order to obtain the required knot in $\mathbb{R}^{n+2}$ (and not in $S^{n+2}$ ). (In the smooth case one can use the stereographic projection and a constructive version of the Weierstrass approximation theorem to obtain a polynomial map $f$.)

Now it is clear that Theorem 1 follows from the Lemma 2 below:

LEMMA 2. There exists an algorithm which for any given Turing machine $T$ and its input $\lambda$ constructs a finite presentation of group $H$ with the following properties: (1) There exists an element $h \in H$ such that $H /[h, H]=\{e\}$; (2) The second homology group of $H$ is trivial; (3) $H$ is trivial if and only if $T$ eventually halts when it starts its work with $\lambda$.

Proof. In many proofs of the algorithmic unsolvability of the word problem for finitely presented groups one actually describes an algorithm constructing for a given Turing machine $T$ and its input $\lambda$ a finite presentation of a group $G$ and a word representing an element $w \in G$ such that $w=e$ in $G$ if and only if $T$ eventually halts, when it starts its work with the input $\lambda$ (cf. [R], [AC]). The Adian-Rabin "witness" construction (cf. [M], pp. 13-14) enables one to construct a finite presentation of a group $G_{w}$ such that $G_{w}$ is trivial if and only if $w=e$ in $G$. Moreover, if $w \neq e$ in $G$ then $G$ embeds in $G_{w}$. To get this finite presentation one adds to the list of generators of $G$ (denoted by $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{k}$) 3 new generators $a, b, c$ and to the list of relations of $G$ the following $(k+3)$ new relations:


\begin{align*}
& a^{-1} b a=c^{-1} b^{-1} c b c  \tag{1}\\
& a^{-2} b^{-1} a b a^{2}=c^{-2} b^{-1} c b c^{2}  \tag{2}\\
& a^{-3}[w, b] a^{3}=c^{-3} b c^{3}  \tag{3}\\
& a^{-(3+i)} x_{i} b a^{(3+i)}=c^{-(3+i)} b c^{(3+i)}, \quad i=1,2, \ldots, k \tag{4}
\end{align*}


It is not difficult to see (and the proof is given in [M] on pp.14-15) that the normal closure of $w$ in $G_{w}$ is $G_{w}$. (This fact is used in [M] to demonstrate that $G_{w}$ is trivial if $w=e$ in $G$.) The proof uses only the relations (1)-(4) and goes as follows: Obviously, $[w, b]$ belongs to the normal closure of $w$. Hence, (3) implies that $b$ belongs to the normal closure of $w$. Now (4) implies that for any $i x_{i}$ belongs to the normal closure of $w$, and (1) implies that $c$ belongs to the normal closure of $w$. Now (2) implies that $a$ belongs to the normal closure of $w$.

The relations (1)-(4) can be rewritten in the following equivalent form:


\begin{align*}
& {\left[b c a^{-1}, b\right]=c b^{-1}}  \tag{1'}\\
& {\left[b c^{2} a^{-2} b^{-1}, a\right]=c a^{-1}}  \tag{2'}\\
& {\left[c^{3} a^{-3},[w, b]\right][w, b]=b}  \tag{3'}\\
& x_{i}=\left[a^{(3+i)} c^{-(3+i)}, b\right], \quad i=1,2, \ldots, k . \tag{4'}
\end{align*}


Using (3') one can replace (1') by the following equivalent relation:
$$c[b, w]\left[[w, b], c^{3} a^{-3}\right]\left[b, b c a^{-1}\right]\left[b c^2 a^{-2} b^{-1}, a\right]=e\tag{1''}$$
and then replace $\left(2'\right)$ by the following equivalent relation:
$$a[b, w]\left[[w, b], c^{3} a^{-3}\right]\left[b, b c a^{-1}\right]\left[b c^{2} a^{-2} b^{-1}, a\right]=e \tag{2''}$$
